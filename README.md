More help
----
* This is very neat for new PC initialization. Mostly for debian/ubuntu or its derived destros.

* Notice that: For some vim users to use taglist/ctags, they would need to install the package "ctags". For example on debian/ubuntu ```sudo apt-get install ctags``` , or on centOS/Fedora/RHEL ```sudo yum install ctags```, or on archlinux ```pacman -S ctags```
* The ```init.sh``` and the ```cp_files.sh``` are very neat for new users both for ubuntu12.04 and ubuntu14.04.
```init.sh``` is compatible with debian7/ubuntu12.04. It's not compatible with ubuntu14.04 due to that ubuntu14.04 has changed some packages. The ```cp_files.sh``` will copy those dotfiles to the system user's home folder.
* There's a Python IDE in there. Type *:Ide* in the Vim prompt console.
For example.
